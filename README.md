when everyone think of a cartoon or a cartoon character they would think about someone who is funny , heroistic and good looking but rarely people think about a person with a Golden Heart ,the heart which loves even the person who it hates at a certain situation, that heart which made me fall for it . Maybe he is lazy , not that good looking but he can do anything for his friend Doraemon.
My favorite cartoon character is Nobita .Well everyone who see the cartoon would wish for Doraemon in their life .But I want to be Doraemon in some Nobita’s life . And whenever i think of it ,the first think which comes in my mind is how great is the bond between them and I remember the way Nobita is to cry for his friend last but not the least “their hugs”.

“Once Doraemon gets angry upon Nobita that he isn’t doing any work and he is fully depending upon his gadgets. Then Doraemon says to Nobita that “one day or the other I have to leave you and I want you to find a solution for your problems”. After listening to this Nobita becomes sad, his eyes filled with tears of sorrow and pain of losing his friend. He answered back to Doraemon with all the courage he had “I can leave without you and you may happily return to your place.”Nobita goes out without seeing Doraemon, well he was trying to hide his tears which were rolling down his eyes, He goes to the ground. Meanwhile, Jiaan comes and troubles Nobita but this time without running away Nobita recalls all the words Doraemon had said: “Can you ever defeat Jiaan and Sunio without asking for my help.” Nobita challenges Jiaan, he falls down continuously but all the time he fell he woke up with a word saying I’ll not give up. At last Jiaan accept his failure meanwhile Doraemon was worried about Nobita and comes in search of him. He finds Nobita on the ground who was almost falling unconscious and says “you saw …. I defeated him “. Then Doraemon carried Nobita to their house. At that moment after reaching home Nobita was still unconscious while Doraemon recollected all the cherishing moments he spent with Nobita for the one last time and leaves him. After many days Nobita misses Doraemon and wishes that Doraemon come back while his mother asks him whether Doraemon will return? Nobita says he will never return back: with a smile.

When he goes to his room he sees a robot standing, who too miss Nobita a lot thorough out these days. And that robot says I have returned. Nobita says I missed you a lot.
Everyone sees Doraemon as a robot according to me he isn’t just a robot but he is that friend, no one can think off. I saw the heart and the bond of Nobita and Doraemon which is infinite and unbreakable. I conclude that if you want someone or something and pray for it with full of love and hope. Then even the universe will be on your side.
